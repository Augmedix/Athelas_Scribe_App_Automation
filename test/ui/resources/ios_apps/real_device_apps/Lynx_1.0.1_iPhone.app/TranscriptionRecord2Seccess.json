We just have to get that cholesterol back down and keep an eye on the protein and see if there's any changes, okay? And if that does continue, we'll increase the losartan. For example, your pressure today, what was it, 125/78? So, the other factor that can determine if losartan is increased or not is the blood pressure. If it's too low, I don't like to increase it, because it will go even lower. if you don't feel more tired than usual, or dizzy, I would keep it at that level. Are you still taking Tramadol for your our back pain? ",
