While most causes of LBP among older adults are nonspecific and self limiting, seniors are prone to develop certain LBP pathologies and or chronic LBP given their age related physical and psychosocial changes. Unfortunately, no review has previously summarised, discussed various factors that may affect the effective LBP management among older adults. Accordingly, the objectives of the current narrative review were to comprehensively summarise common causes and risk factors of developing severe LBP in older adults. 2. Research directions, existing evidence suggests that prevalence rates of severe and chronic LBP increase with older age. As compared to working age adults, older adults are more likely to develop certain LBP pathologies, e. G, osteoporotic vertebral fractures, tumours, spinal infection, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Importantly, various age related physical, psychological, and mental changes, e. G, spinal degeneration, comorbidities, physical inactivity, age related changes in central pain processing, and dementia, as well as multiple risk factors, e. G, genetic, gender, and ethnicity, may affect the prognosis and management of LBP in older adults. Collectively, by understanding the impacts of various factors on the assessment and treatment of older adults with LBP. Both clinicians and researchers can work toward the direction of more cost effective and personalized LBP management for older people. Risk factors: spine, disc degeneration, Management Low back pain Elderly Genetics Brain Assessment Go to Background The average lifespan of humans has dramatically increased in the last decade due to the advance in medicine. 1. According to the United Nations, the world population of individuals aged 60 years or above will triple by 2,050. In the UK alone, approximately 22 percent of the population will be 65 years or older by 2,031, exceeding the number of those aged less than 25 years (three). However, the fast growing aging population also increases the likelihood of noncommunicable diseases, e. G. Musculoskeletal complaints. Studies have suggested that the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in older adults ranges from 65 to 85% (four 5) with 36 to 70 percent of them suffering from back pain (five 6). Low back pain is the most common health problem among older adults that results in pain and disability (4. 7 to 10 older adults, aged 65 years or above, are the 2nd most common age group to visit physicians for LBP. 11. Earlier research suggests that LBP prevalence progressively increases from teenage (twelve) to 60 years of age and then declines (thirteen-sixteen), which may be ascribed to occupational exposure among working age adults (seventeen, 18), or age related changes in pain. Perception or stoicism, 19). However, recent studies have revealed that LBP remains ubiquitous among older adults at their retirement ages, 20, 21. In population based studies, the 1 year prevalence of LBP in community dwelling seniors ranged from 13 to 50% across the world (four, 13, 22 to 24). Similarly, while up to 80% of older residents in long term care facility experience substantial musculoskeletal pain (25 to 27), and onethree of these cases are LBP (28), often older. Residents' pain is underreported and inadequately treated (25-twenty 7). It is noteworthy that both the incidence and prevalence of severe and chronic LBP increase with older age 13, 29, 30. Docking A. Al, 17, reported that the 1 month prevalence of disabling back pain pain that affected daily activities within the past month increased from 3.8% among people aged between 70 7 79 years to 9.7% among those aged between 91 100 years. Williams and coworkers, 31, also found that individuals aged 80 years or above were 3 times more likely to experience severe LBP than those aged between 5059 years. Because severe LBP usually results in poor treatment outcomes and functional disability, 17.32 Timely LBP management of older adults is crucial. Importantly, compared to working age adults, older adults aged 65 years or above are more likely to develop chronic LBP that lasts for more than 3 months (thirteen:thirty three). A Spanish study found that the prevalence rates of chronic LBP among females and males aged 65 years or older were 24.2 and 12.3 percent respectively (thirty 4), while an Israeli study documented that the prevalence of chronic LBP in people aged 77 years was as high as 58% (thirty 5). Notwithstanding the high prevalence of LBP among older adults, their pain is usually undertreated. A recent study showed approximately 25% of senior nursing home residents with chronic pain did not receive analgesics, and only 50% of all analgesics were prescribed as standing orders at suboptimal doses, which did not follow geriatric clinical guidelines, 36, 37. According to those guidelines, older patients with chronic pain should receive analgesics as a standing dose rather than on an as needed basis in order to ensure adequate concentration of analgesic in serum for continuous pain relief, 3638. Standing dose analgesics are particularly important for people with cognitive impairment because they cannot appropriately request medication, while under treatment of LBP in older adults may be ascribed to the avoidance of high dose analgesics prescription. It may also be attributed to the difficulty in identifying the presence or causes of LBP. Research has shown that less than 50% of primary care physicians have strong confidence in diagnosing the causes of chronic LBP in older adults (32). Consequently, this may result in over reliance on medical imaging or improper LBP management, e. G. Undertreatment. Imperatively, untreating or undertreating older adults with LBP may result in sleep disturbances, withdrawal from social and recreational activities, psychological distress, impeded cognition, malnutrition, rapid deterioration of functional ability, and falls (thirty 9). These LBP related consequences may compromise their quality of life and increase their long term health. 40. Although various medical associations have published clinical guidelines on conservative management of chronic pain in older adults, 37, 41, 42. There is paucity of literature summarizing various causes or risk factors of developing severe LBP among older adults. Since a better understanding of these factors can improve LBP management, the objectives of the current narrative review were to summarise potential causes of LBP, risk factors for chronic LBP special consideration for LBP management, e. G, pain evaluations among patients with dementia. In older people aged 60 years or older, and future research directions. Search strategies and selection criteria potential articles were identified for review through PubMed from 01/01, 1990, to 11/30, 2016. Search terms included keywords and medical subject headings related to low back pain, LBP, older adult, senior, elderly, cognitive, impairment, dementia, non verbal, community dwelling, nursing home, long term care facilities, risk factor, brain, genetics, assessment, and intervention. Various Boolean terms were used in conjunction with various search terms. Articles were selected based on the relevance of topic and restricted to the English language. The reference lists of relevant articles were also included for review. A total of 2,182 citations were identified from the search. Of them, Information from 320 articles was used in the current review. Potential causes of low back pain non specific or mechanical low back pain like among young adults, the majority of LBP among older adults has no definite pathology, e. G. Fracture or inflammation, and is diagnosed as nonspecific LBP. These patients experience LBP that is altered by posture, activity, or time of the day. LBP may originate from different pain sources: 43 Disc degeneration on magnetic resonance imaging is more prevalent with age progression and as such in older adults however, it is less likely to be the pain source as compared to young adults (forty 4). Conversely, facet joint pain in seniors may present as localised LBP with or without posterior thigh pain during walking. The pain may be aggravated during trunk extension, ipsilateral lateral flexion, and or rotation (forty 5). Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, defined as forward or backward slippage of a cephalic vertebrae over a caudal 1. Secondary to a degenerated disc and is common among women aged 60 years or older and is usually associated with facet hypertrophy (forty 6). The presence of degenerative spondylolisthesis alongside facet hypertrophy and thickening of ligamentum flavum may result in pain, spinal stenosis, and neurological deficits in older adults (forty sixforty seven). Although spinal degenerative changes may induce LBP, not all anomalies on lumbar medical imaging are related to LBP. Because abnormal imaging phenotypes are ubiquitous among asymptomatic, older adults (forty 4, 40 8 to 50). Additionally, LBP may originate from structures other than the lumbar spine. Many older patients with chronic LBP display physical findings comparable to sacroiliac joint pain (83.6 percent ) and myofascial pain (95.5 percent (fifty 1). Symptoms of sacroiliac joint disorders are similar to facet joint pain, which includes localized LBP with or without posterior thigh pain that can be alleviated by lying. 52. Myofascial pain is a localized palpable tenderness and tightness within a muscle that resists passive stretching and reproduces predictable referred pain pattern on palpation. 53. Myofascial pain in lumbar muscles or piriformis are common among seniors. Collectively, it is difficult to identify the sources of nonspecific LBP because its causes are usually multifactorial. Various factors, e. G, anxiety, depression, coping strategies, and pain Genes can modify the severity and chronicity of LBP, 31, 35, 50. Radiculopathy While nonspecific LBP is usually localised at the lumbar region and or thigh, the compression of nerve roots or spinal meninges by degenerated spinal structures, e. G, herniated discs, facet joints, and or epidural fat (fifty 4) may lead to radiculopathy that radiates distal to the knee. The clinical presentation of radiculopathy depends on the location of neural tissue compression, lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative changes, e. G, osteophytes and hypertrophic ligamentum. At a single or multiple levels may lead to unilateral or bilateral radiculopathy and neurogenic claudication with or without LBP 55 to 57. Neurogenic claudication is characterised by numbness and heaviness of legs after prolonged walking, which can be eased by a flexed position, e. G, forward leaning or sitting, 58 to 60. On the contrary, the presence of narrowing in the lateral recess or in the vertebral foramen may result in radicular leg pain without LBP. 61. Research on asymptomatic or some clinical populations have suggested that the prevalence of degenerative LSS ranged from 6 to 13.1 percent (sixty 2, 63) and the rate increases with age (sixty 4). A population based imaging study found that the prevalence of degenerative LSS, I. E, is less than or equal to 10 millimeter Anteroposterior diameter of spinal canal, in young, and lieutenant, 40 years, and older adults, and GT, 60 years) were 4.0 and 14.3 percent, respectively (sixty 4). Osteoporotic vertebral fractures given the hormonal changes. Following menopause, women are more susceptible to osteoporotic fracture and related LBP (sixty five-sixty six). Approximately 25% of all postmenopausal women suffer from vertebral compression fracture and the prevalence of this condition increases with age: 65. It is estimated that the prevalence of vertebral compression fracture in women aged 80 years or above can be as high as 40% (sixty 5). As compared to patients with nonspecific patients with vertebral fractures experience more disability. 67. Unfortunately, only 1 third of the cases are correctly diagnosed because many seniors assume bone and joint pain as part of the aging process (68). As such, physicians should pay more attention to examine seniors with acute onset of localised LBP that may or may not present with paraspinal muscle spasm. A recent systematic review suggests that older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma are the risk factors for vertebral fractures, 69. The common site of compression fractures occur at the thoracolumbar region: 70 to 72. Depending on the mechanism of fractures, some vertebral compression fracture may result in radiculopathy. The most common fracture mechanism is due to a flexion movement or trauma that causes an anterior wedge fracture. 73 Since the posterior vertebral body remains intact and the collapsed anterior vertebra heals Without regaining height, it will result in a kyphotic deformity without compromising the spinal chord. 73. Another type of vertebral compression fracture involves the center part of the vertebral body without affecting the anterior or posterior wall. This type of fracture does not affect the spinal cord. A less common osteoporotic vertebral fracture involves the axial compression of the entire vertebral body or the posterior portions of the vertebra that may compress the spinal canal and results in neurological deficit, 71-seventy 3. De Novo Degenerative Lumber Scoliosis De Novo degenerative lumbar scoliosisde novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis is a spinal deformity in older adults that results in disabling LVP, leg pain and suboptimal quality of life. DNDLS is defined as a lumbar scoliotic curve with a Cobb angle is greater than or equal to 10\u00b0 in the coronal plane that develops after 50 years of age. In people without a history of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, (77). The reported prevalence of DNDLS in the adult population has ranged from 8.3-13.3 percent (seventy eight-eighty), while that in adults older than 60 years was as high as 68% (eighty 1). Multifactorial causes have been suggested for DNDLS, including intervertebral disc degeneration and genetic predisposition, 82 to 84. It is believed that the asymmetrical biomechanical load on the vertebral end plate on the concave side of the curve may cause inflammatory responses in the end plate and adjacent bone marrow of the vertebral body, which may result in LBP. This premise has been substantiated by a recent study that found: 1. Bone marrow edema in DNDLS was more prevalent in older adults with LBP than those without LBP. 2. Bone marrow edema was more frequent on the concave side of the DNDLS curve, and 3. The location of bone marrow edema on MRI was closely associated with local lumbar tenderness (eighty 7). However, no significant relation between Cobb angle and LBP symptoms in older adults has been reported. 81. Interestingly, the curve progression rate of DNDLS is higher than that of adolescent. Idiopathic scoliosis: 77. 3 radiological variables, I. E, increased intervertebral disc degeneration (an intercrest line passing through the L5 level, not L4 or higher, and apical lateral vertebral translation for at least 6 millimeters, have been identified as predictors of DNDLS curve progression. 77 tumours Cancers The incidence rates for all neoplasms exponentially increase with age. 88. Although only less than 1% of the causes of LBP presented to primary care physicians are attributed to spinal tumours, 89. A majority of these tumours are related to metastasis and only a handful of them are primary tumours, The common metastatic sources of LBP are prostate and kidney although primary malignant tumours are also be found in older adults (ninety). Unlike young adults, seniors are unlikely to have primary benign tumours, e. G, osteoblastoma, osteochondroma, osteoma, eosinophilic granuloma, and aneurysmal bone cysts. Clinically, typical symptom of spinal tumors is progressive, unremitting, localised, or radiating pain that are aggravated by movement, worse at night, and cannot be eased by rest. In addition, patients may experience weakness and feel the presence of a lump (ninety 6. Spinal infection vertebral osteomyelitis is a life threatening infectious musculoskeletal disease in older people caused by an infection of vertebral bones, 97. Given the growing ageing population, the incidence of Voe is increasing: 98 to 100. Although the reported incidence rate of Voe in the general population only ranges from 2.5 to 7 cases per 100,000 people years (ninety nineone 100 and one). The mortality of these patients can be as high as 12% (99,102). 4 causes of Voe have been suggested. First, pathogenic bacteria may be disseminated hematogenously from a distant infected source and multiply at the metaphysial arterioles of vertebral bone that causes microabscess formation, bone necrosis, and fistula within bone. 103. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen. 2nd, tuberculavo may occur in seniors who have contracted tuberculous infection at young age. Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be transmitted to and remains in the vertebral bone. Age related deterioration of the host's immunity or certain incidences, e. G, osteoporosis, trauma, or non myobacterial infections, may reactivate mTuberculosis in the bone that causes osteomyelitis. 3rd, aerobic gram negative bacilli in older men with urinary tract infection may rarely reach the lumbar spine through Batson's plexus and cause vo.97. 4th iatrogenic infection following spinal surgeries or injections may cause vertebral osteomyelitis. Clinically, patients with Vo may present with fever, elevated C reactive protein, paraspinal muscle spasm, LBP, neurological deficits, and epidural abscess. Additionally, patients with tuberculous osteomyelitis may have a groin mass. Because of the presence of abscess in PSOS muscle, 97. Taken together: greater age and certain comorbidities, e. G, diabetes, hemodialysis usage, liver cirrhosis, malignancy, and infectious endocarditis, are known to increase inpatient mortality of Vo. 99. Clinicians should be suspicious of Vo if older patients with the above mentioned comorbidities demonstrate Unidentified fever, and or LBP. 90 9. Clinical findings, laboratory results, bone scintigraphy, and or spinal biopsy are usually used to make differential diagnosis of VOC. Similarly, older people are more prone to develop pyogenic spondylodositis, which involves the infection of disc and adjacent vertebral bones. It has been estimated that the incidence rate of non tuberculous or non postoperative spondylosisitis in the general population is approximately 0.2-2.4 cases per 100,000 people years, 101, 104 to 106, while that for people over 65 years old is as high as 9.8 cases per 100000 person years, 107. A recent population based study reported that males aged 70 years or older displayed 6 times higher incidence rate of pyogenic nontuberculosis spondylosis than males under 70 years old. Likewise, females aged 70 years or above were 3 times more likely to exhibit pyogenic nontuberculosis spondylodecitis than younger counterparts, 98. Clinical presentations of spondylodositis are comparable though. S aureus is the major cause of pyogenic spondylodecitis, 108, while other bacteria, e.g, streptococcus and pneumococcus, may also cause the disease. 98 magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for imaging pyogenic spondylosisitis, which is visualized as reduced signal intensity of the affected disc and adjacent vertebral bodies with unclear end plates definition on T1 weighted images and enhanced signal intensity on T2 weighted images, 109. Visceral diseases Since it is not uncommon for seniors to have comorbidities, it is important to consider other non spinal pathologies that usually present as chronic LBP. Several visceral diseases, e.g, dissecting abdominal aortic aneurism, cholecystolethiasis, nephrolithiasis, prostatitis, urinary tract infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease, have known to generate symptoms comparable to chronic LBP 110. Chordaequina syndrome This syndrome is ascribed to the compression of multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots in the spinal canal that lead to bowel, bladder, and or sexual dysfunction, as well as perianal region numbness: 111. Depending on the location of nerve roots compression, patients with chordaequina syndrome may or may not experience sciatica. Potential causes of this syndrome include central disc, herniation or spondylolisthesis at the lower lumbar levels, spinal tumors, dislocated fracture, and abscess within the spinal canals (111). Additionally, this syndrome may be secondary to some rare iatrogenic causes, e.g, spinal anesthesia or postoperative hematoma. Risk factors of developing severe chronic low back pain in older adults although most LBP is self limiting and begins to improve after a few days and resolves within a month (110). Some patients are susceptible to chronic LBP that lead to significant disability. While age is a well known risk factor for chronic LBP (112), other factors may perpetuate LBP in odler adults (fig 1). The understanding of these factors can help identify high risk patients and improve their LBP management. Since older adults usually face both age related physical and psychosocial issues, comprehensive assessments and treatments are needed to effectively manage LBP in seniors.",
