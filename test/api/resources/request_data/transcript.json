            "transcript": "Hello. Hello, Doctor. Okay, I have been doing with his hip pain for about 3 months now and it is not getting any better. Don't know. Let's figure out what's going on. Have you gotten it looked at before? No. Okay well how did you hurt it. I was lifting some boxes helping a friend move and I thought I pulled my groin, but he just never got better and in the past few weeks it has really gotten a lot worse. I have been going easy and taking Advil religiously 400 mg 4 times a day, but the Advil has really been bothering my Crohn's disease, been giving me severe stomach aches and diarrhea in the last few weeks. Oh yeah, sometimes long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories like Advil and ibuprofen can cause that. Do you remember exactly when you were diagnosed with the lymphocytic colitis probably about a year ago. Are you taking any other medications. I am on Carbatrol and budesonide. Right now, I have this prescription face cream. 1 were you first diagnosed with the seizures. This is about 10. The medicines helped a lot. I only have simple partial seizures every other day. I haven't had a tonic-clonic 1 in a while. Are he followed by a neurologist right now. No actually need a referral to a neurologist here in California. Okay I can definitely help with that. Do you have an established gastroenterologist here? No, I need a referral to that too. Okay, so going back to your hip pain. What would you rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no pain at all and 10 the worst pain imaginable. This is about a 6 that is on a normal basis. When I move it, I would read it higher. Okay and described that pain for me is a dull pullsing, aching, it aches constantly and then sharp when I walk. Dizzy or hip click when you are walking. Sometimes, where exactly is the pain located like right here in over here in my groin and around in the butt area too. Have you tried anything else to to relieve the pain besides Advil. I have been taking some leftover oxycodone I have from an ankle surgery. I had 2 years ago. Okay, how often are you taking that. Whatever the pain has gotten really bad and take like 100 mg maybe 3 times per week. Okay, heavy tried any physical therapy or an injection. No, I haven't tried any of those. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your right foot, no any pain with coughing, sneezing, or sleeping. No just pain when I move it. Alright, let me examine her hip. Okay. Okay, I think we should make a treatment plan according to him last a tabular impingement. I would like you to work on your hip motion and strengthening your hip with a trainer. I am placing an order for for physical therapy. I will send you a list of different locations where you can find a trainer through the patient portal. I am also going to write you a prescription for tramadol. I think this will work better as a pain killer than the oxycodone. Start with 50 mg in the morning with food and hopefully the physical therapy will improve due to a point where you won't need the tramadol. So what is that plan does not work. We will see how this goes. Make sure to work on it regularly and lets meet up again in 4 weeks. If you don't see any improvement by then, I can place a referral to orthopedics. Alright, hopefully this works. Yes, I really hope to, it was very nice meeting you mark. Yes, so it is very nice meeting you. See in 4 weeks. Yes. CU in 4 weeks."
